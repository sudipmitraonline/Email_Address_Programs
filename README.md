In this program, we are using search() method of re module. so let’s see the description about it.

re.search() : This method either returns None (if the pattern doesn’t match), or re.MatchObject that contains information about the matching part of the string. This method stops after the first match, so this is best suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data.
